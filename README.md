### Hi there 👋

- 🧑‍🔬 I’m currently improving my skills on **Artificial Intelligence** / **Machine Learning** (including GenAI and Agentic AI) and **Solutions Architecture**.
- 🌱 My current programming language learning target is **Rust**, but I keep practicing **Python** and **Javascript**/**Typescript**.
- 🔭 I am always looking out for what is coming next, specially for Cloud, Data, AI and Web.
- 👯 If you have an open source project where you think I could help, tell me.
- 🏞 Hobbies: Watercolor painting (specially scientific illustrations) and hiking.
